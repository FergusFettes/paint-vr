# Paint-VR (WIP)

This is a 3D paint clone for VR. It is surprisingly fun to sculpt in VR. I imagine I will be adding many more features to this as time goes on.

Read about how I made it (and learned Oculus/JavaScript/Android development) [here](www.fergusfettes.com/posts/oculus-paint/).

It is available at [paint.fergusfettes.com](paint.fergusfettes.com).
